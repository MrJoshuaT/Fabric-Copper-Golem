# Copper Golem for Fabric ü§ñ
Sadly at __Minecraft Live 2021__ the Copper Golem did not win the vote to get added into 1.18.

But this little golem is so cute I did not want to see it in Minecraft!

> Functionality is experimental and is based on what Mojang announced at Minecraft Live 2021.

### Requires at least Fabric API 0.41.0

## Features

### Spawning
* The spawning combo is a bottom __Copper Block__, middle __Carved Pumpkin__ Block and top __Lightning Rod__.

### Goals, in priority order
* Wandering around, this is taken straight from the Iron Golem code
* Looking around
* Find buttons to press
* Look at player
* Look at Iron Golems, as they're the big brother

### Oxidation
* Random ticks will cause oxidation to increment, of which are 4 levels (0-3)
* Interacting with the mob with Honeycomb with Wax it
* Interacting with the mob with an any Axe will unwax it, if waxed, otherwise if not at first oxidation level will deoxidise it by 1 level
* Lightning strikes will set oxidation level to 0 (min level)

## Current to do list
### Misc
* Hitbox is a not great, should be smaller on X,Z and bigger on Y?

... more to be added
